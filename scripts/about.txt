\procedures\ - Contains subfolders for steps in transformation sequences, where both input and output are DDF (Data Description Format)
\importers\ - Contains generic scripts for bringin data into DDF from other formats. (Don't put scripts here which deal with specific datasets.)
\exporters\ - Contains generic scripts for bringin data from DDF to other formats. (Don't put scripts here which deal with specific datasets.)
\utils\ - Contain any other script useful for dealing with data in Open Numbers.
