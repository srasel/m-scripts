This folder contains human tests used to ensure the scripts perform correctly.
Create the same subfolder structure as in /scripts/ 
and for each script, create a folder with the same name with the prefix: "test"

So a script with the path 
/scripts/procedures/interpolate.m

Will have a human "tests" folder here
/scripts/procedures/interpolate_tests/

containing files to test this script
